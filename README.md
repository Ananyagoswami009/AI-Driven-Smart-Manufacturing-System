ðŸ§  AI-Powered System for Smart Manufacturing using Generative Design Optimization and Multi-Task Learning
In this project, I developed an advanced AI-driven system tailored for smart manufacturing environments. The system leverages Generative Design Optimization to efficiently allocate material resources and enhance design structures, reducing waste while maximizing performance and functionality.

To further improve the manufacturing pipeline, I implemented Multi-Task Learning (MTL) techniques, enabling the model to simultaneously learn and perform several critical tasks:

Defect Detection: The system identifies defects in manufactured components using computer vision and deep learning models, ensuring high reliability and minimizing failure rates.

Efficiency Prediction: It forecasts the operational efficiency of manufacturing processes under various conditions, aiding in workflow optimization and preventive maintenance.

Quality Assurance: Real-time monitoring and evaluation ensure the final products meet predefined quality standards, with the model adapting dynamically to changing input data or production anomalies.

The integration of these components facilitates real-time decision-making, enabling manufacturers to respond proactively to issues, improve product quality, and reduce operational costs. This solution showcases the powerful synergy of AI, optimization, and real-time analytics in modern manufacturing.
